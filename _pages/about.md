Hey! I am Srija, a dual-degree student pursuing my Bachelor’s and Master’s in Computer Science at IIIT Hyderabad. I’m interested in Machine Learning research and have always loved languages in general. I’ve been lucky enough to work with amazing professors like [Manish Shrivastava](https://iiit.ac.in/publications/~m.shrivastava), [Ponnurangam Kumaraguru](https://www.linkedin.com/in/ponguru/), [Karthik Vaidhyanathan](https://karthikvaidhyanathan.com/), [Vivek Gupta](https://vgupta123.github.io/), and [Dan Roth](https://www.cis.upenn.edu/~danroth/), and I even got to collaborate with Adobe Research at one point.

Lately, I’ve been really curious about **Multimodal Models** - especially when it comes to understanding their capabilities and making them more robust. Apart from that, I am also interested in **Interpretability and AI Safety**. I’m particularly passionate about figuring out how to make models - especially multimodal models - more transparent and interpretable, and also understanding their inner workings better.

I’ve also interned at Google twice - once as a STEP Intern and later as a SWE Intern, where I worked in the GCP Metering Team and Android PDF team respectively. I will be joining Google as an intern for the third time this summer!

Outside of work, I love diving into DIY projects. You’ll also find me listening to indie music, swimming, at the gym, or spending hours watching videos of Japanese stationery hauls. I also love to travel and explore new places. I’m always up for a good conversation, so feel free to reach out to me!
